For years i stood by watching the main stream media push housing and stocks with impunity;  using nothing but one liners and hype…   “No better time to buy a house”, “buy stocks for the long run”, “buy and hold” and each and every time investors fell flat on their faces, either flat broke or in debt…

Lets face it; the average American/person listens to the mainstream media with out ever knowing that they are just a bunch of paid shills; only there to provide mind numbing entertainment.  They will hype anything their ad masters push them to sell; with the end result being YOU getting screwed…  We’re here to make sure that doesnt happen again.

Unchecked is a mentality and a state of mind, the mentality to reason, understand and let the data and history be your guide and the state of mind to be free as an individual to think for yourself,  free of persuasion by media or anyone else.  

We’ve lived through a stock bubble and a housing bubble; and now we are living through the dollar bubble and when it bursts (and it is bursting/will burst) that will be the most devastating bubble to pop.  Its impact will be felt around the world and most severely here at home in the US.
